-the narrator(叙事者、讲述者) crashes in the desert(沙漠、荒漠) and makes the acquaintance(相识) of the little prince

​		So I lived(过着) my life(生活) alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic(机械师、技工、机修工) nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely(刚刚，勉强，几乎不) enough drinking water to last a week.
​		The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation(住所、聚住地). I was more isolated(孤立的、孤独的、偏远的) than a shipwrecked(遭遇海难的) sailor(水手、海员) on a raft(筏子) in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd(奇怪的) little voice. It said: 
​		"If you please-- draw me a sheep(羊、绵羊、胆小鬼)!"
​		"What!"
​		"Draw me a sheep!"
　　I jumped to my feet(一跃而起、跳了起来), completely thunderstruck(惊愕的、吓坏了的、遭雷击的). I blinked(眨眼) my eyes hard(努力的、猛烈地). I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary(非凡的、特别的、离奇的) small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait(肖像、画像、人像) that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming(迷人的) than its model.
　　 That, however, is not my fault(错误). The grown-ups discouraged(阻止、劝阻、不鼓励、使气馁) me in my painter‘s career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.
　　Now I stared at this sudden apparition(幽灵、幻影、离奇出现的东西) with my eyes fairly(相当地、简直、公平地) starting out of my head in astonishment(吃惊、惊愕). Remember, I had crashed(坠毁) in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet(然而) my little man seemed neither to be straying(迷路) uncertainly(犹豫地、没把握地、不确定地) among the sands, nor to be fainting(虚弱的、模糊的) from fatigue(疲劳、疲乏) or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion(细微的迹象) of a child lost(迷路的) in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him: "But-- what are you doing here?"
　　And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: "If you please-- draw me a sheep..."
　　When a mystery is too overpowering(无法抗拒的、压倒性的), one dare not disobey. Absurd(荒唐) as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet(张) of paper and my fountain-pen(钢笔). But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on(专注于) geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap(小伙子、家伙) (a little crossly(生气地), too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:"That doesn‘t matter. Draw me a sheep..."
　　But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often(常常，偶尔，注：这里到底该怎么翻译呢？我看有一些将其翻译成了so far). It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded(惊讶) to hear the little fellow greet it with(对某事作出某种反应), "No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome(笨重的、累赘的、难处理的). Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep." 
　　So then I made a drawing. 
　　He looked at it carefully, then he said: "No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another." 
　　So I made another drawing. 
　　 My friend smiled gently and indulgently(宽容地). "You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram(公羊). It has horns(角)." 
　　So then I did my drawing over once more(再一次). 
　　But it was rejected(拒绝) too, just like the others. "This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."
　　By this time my patience was exhausted(耗尽), because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart(take apart拆开). So I tossed off(毫不费力地做出) this drawing. 
　　And I threw out an explanation with it. 
　　"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."
　　I was very surprised to see a light break(领悟) over the face of my young judge(法官): 
　　"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"
　　"Why?"
　　"Because where I live everything is very small..."
　　"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep that I have given you." 
　　He bent his head over the drawing: 
　　"Not so small that-- Look! He has gone to sleep..."
　　And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.
